695,The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.,0
696,Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.,0
697,The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.,1
698,It doesn't make you look cool.,0
699,"Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.",1
700,"Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.",1
701,"Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.",0
702,You can't beat the price on these.,1
703,"* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!",1
704,lightweight and works well.,1
705,So just beware.,0
706,I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.,1
707,So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.,0
708,This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.,1

718,"Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).",0
719,It was a great phone.,1
720,if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.,0
721,"Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.",1
722,My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.,1
723,This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!,1
724,Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!,0
725,"In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim ""Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?",1

753,Blue Ant is easy to use.,1
754,Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.,1
755,The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.,0

763,Just what I wanted.,1
764,This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.,0
765,wont work right or atleast for me.,0
766,in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.,0

781,I am sorry I made this purchase.,0
782,I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.,0
783,Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.,0
784,It was horrible!.,0
785,I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.,0
786,This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.,0
